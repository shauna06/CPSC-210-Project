***Book Tracking Application - Project Proposal***

## A Brief Overview of the Application

For the CPSC 210 project, I propose a book tracking application. This application would allow
users to be able to input information about the books they have been reading to keep 
track of them. Possible features and functionality could include the book object having a title, 
author name, genre, number of pages, month & year read, whether the book was completed, 
and the user's rating. The application would keep track of all the books the user has input in a list 
of books that could be accessed as the user's collection.

***Who will use this application?***

This application would be open for all, though it would be primarily targeted toward individuals who 
like to read, particularly enough so that they would want to keep track of the books they have read.

***Why is this of interest to me?***

The idea behind this project is meaningful to me because I have always been an avid reader from the moment I learned 
how to read. I am thrilled at 
the possibility of making my own application that even I could use to input the books I have been reading. While there are
a few book tracking applications currently out there, I hope to add my own flare to this personal project and potentially
consider features other applications have not thought of yet.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add a book to a collection of books and specify the name of the book, the author,
the number of pages, the genre, the month & year I read it, whether I completed it, and the rating from 1 to 5 with 
increments of 0.25
- As a user, I want to be able to view the titles of my collection of books read 
- As a user, I want to be able to sort the order of books from the most recent to the least recently completed or 
highest rating to the lowest rating and vice versa

the resulting titles after filtering
