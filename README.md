# Book Tracking Application - Project Proposal

## A Brief Overview of the Application

For the CPSC 210 project, I propose a book tracking application. This application would allow
users to be able to input information about the books they have finished reading, so as to keep 
track of them. Possible features and functionality could include the book object having a title, 
author name, genre, number of pages, year published, whether the book was completed, 
and the user's rating. The application would keep track of all the books the user has read in a list 
of books that could be accessed as the users collection of books read.

**Who will use this application?**

This application would be open for all, though it would be primarily targeted toward individuals who 
like to read, enough so that they would want to keep track of the books they have read.

**Why is this of interest to me?**

The idea behind this project is meaningful to me because I have always been an avid reader. I am thrilled at 
the possibility of making my own application that even I could use to input the books I have read. While there are
a few book tracking applications currently out there, I hope to add my own flare to this personal project and potentially
consider features other applications have not thought of yet.
